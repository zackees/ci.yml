"""`ci-lint rust toolchain-build-check`: RUST-009 from real job-log
evidence (issue #5, M2-22 brief).

"Per-run toolchain/std/driver builds detected from job logs: `Compiling
core`/`std`, -Zbuild-std, dylint-driver source builds,
SOLDR_ALLOW_DYLINT_DRIVER_BUILD." Like `ci_lint.runtime.dylint`
(RUST-003), this is deliberately NOT a static check -- whether a run
actually compiled std/core/the Dylint driver from source can only be
proven by reading what that run's build actually printed, not by
inspecting `ci.toml`/workflow YAML. It reads one or more `--log` files
(raw text: `gh run view --job <id> --log`, or any captured stdout).
