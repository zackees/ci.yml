"""`ci-lint dylint coverage`: RUST-003 from real Dylint job evidence.

Round-6E brief, item 2 (zackees/ci.yml#1's acceptance criteria: "a
cross-target job missing the target `rust-std` component" / "a Linux-only
job that omits intended platform lint coverage" must be IDENTIFIED, not
inferred from the runner OS). Neither can be decided statically -- this
module never runs Dylint itself. It reads evidence from one or more
`--log` files, each auto-detected as one of two real shapes:

  - `ci/dylint.py`'s own `--results-out` file: a JSON array of
    `DylintPassResult` records (`{shape, targets, command, seconds,
    returncode}` -- template-python-rust-cmd's own struct, see its
    `ci/dylint.py`). The reliable source: `targets` already names every
    triple (host included) one invocation covered, and `returncode` says
    outright whether that invocation succeeded. Parsed straight into
    `DylintPassResultRecord` frozen dataclasses at the JSON boundary
    (AGENTS.md's typed-boundary rule -- no raw dict survives past
    `_load_results_json`).
  - A raw GitHub Actions job log (`gh run view --job <id> --log`, or any
    captured stdout of the same): matched with compiled regexes for the
    `+ soldr dylint ...`/`+ soldr cargo dylint ...` invocation trace line
    (the shell's own `set -x`-style echo, from `ci/dylint.py`'s `_run`),
    rustc's `Checking with toolchain \\`...\\`` banner (names the HOST
    triple as a suffix -- there is no `--target` flag for the host's own
    native check), a `Finished` profile-completion line, and an
    `error[E0463]: can't find crate for \\`core\\`` + its `the \\`<target>\\`
    target may not be installed` note.

Coverage: every target in `ci_lint.plan.dylint_target_platform_ids(ci)`
(`ci.toml`'s declared `[platforms]`, when `[lint.dylint].targets =
"all-platforms"`) must appear as a COMPLETED check pass in the combined
evidence from every `--log` given. A multi-target invocation covering
several `--target` flags (or one `DylintPassResultRecord.targets` entry
naming several triples) counts for every triple it names -- issue #6's D6
finding that one Linux job checks every declared platform from a single
pass, reproduced live in zackees/template-python-rust-cmd.

An `E0463: can't find crate for \\`core\\`` failure is reported as its own,
more specific RUST-003 finding ("the target's rust-std was never
provisioned") rather than only the generic "not covered" one -- issue #1's
own fbuild evidence (run 36347775473) names this exact error.

zackees/setup-soldr#538/#540 (RUST-004, `ci_lint.cache.audit`) is the
"succeeded but didn't save its cache" defect; this module is the other half
issue #1 asks for -- "did the Dylint job actually cover the platform it
claims to," independent of caching.
