"""`ci-lint cache audit`: live, read-only classification of every cache
entry the GitHub Actions cache API reports, against ci.toml's declared
families (round-4A brief, deliverable 4). Round-6E adds RUST-004: a
`setup-soldr:dylint-output`/`setup-soldr:dylint` family with NO live entry
at all on the default branch, while the default branch's latest run has a
successful `dylint` job -- "a successful Dylint run never saved its output
cache" (setup-soldr#538/#540, zackees/ci.yml#1).

RUST-004 cannot literally recompute setup-soldr's own cache-key hash to
match "the current Cargo.lock hash" the way a `via = "ci-lint"` family's
key can be rebuilt (`ci_lint.cache.keys`): `dylintOutputKey`'s hash covers
`cargo_lock` *together with* `source_revision` (the exact commit SHA),
`target_shape`, and several other inputs ci-lint has no access to
(setup-soldr `src/lib/resolve-setup.ts`, read read-only, ~line 1185); it is
fundamentally source-SHA-keyed, not a reproducible function of Cargo.lock
content alone. An earlier design correlated a family's live entries'
`created_at` against the qualifying job's own `started_at` instead --
proven WRONG live against the real template repo (round-6E): an unrelated
commit (workflow/docs-only) legitimately reproduces the IDENTICAL
`dylintOutputHash` and gets a correct "exact hit - skipping save" (the
existing entry is still perfectly valid; nothing was silently lost), so
"no entry created since this job started" false-positives on ordinary warm
reuse. The only signal ci-lint can trust without literally decoding the
hash is coarser but sound: does ANY live entry for the family exist on the
default branch at all -- exactly zackees/clud's observed failure mode
(zero cache layers reused, ever, on either sampled run). See
`_find_default_branch_dylint_run`/`_check_rust_004` below.

Requires `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` and `actions: read` (listing
caches, and -- when `fetch` is given to `audit_classified`/`run_audit` --
RUST-004's runs/jobs lookup); the PR-state half of CACHE-008 additionally
needs a `GraphQLFn` (also just a read). Never deletes anything -- see
`ci_lint.cache.ops` for trim/janitor/heal/preprune, which reuse this
module's classification and then act on it.
