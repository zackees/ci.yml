"""`ci-lint release verify`: issue #6 §3/§7 + ci.yml#4's release-candidate
gating -- the staged artifact set for an exact candidate SHA must contain
exactly one wheel per declared [platforms] entry (matched by its wheel
platform tag, not by filename guesswork) plus exactly one sdist, every
artifact at the same version, and every wheel passing the existing `wheel
check` (PKG-003/004/005, reused from `ci_lint.runtime.wheel` rather than
re-implemented). Writes `release-manifest.json` (sha256 per artifact, the
candidate SHA, and ci.toml's own digest) into the staged directory.

PKG-006 covers a missing/duplicate/extra artifact or a version mismatch.
Per-wheel native install smoke happens elsewhere (the platform-run job);
this command only *consumes* a `--smoke <dir>` of already-written
`smoke-results/*.json` files and requires a passing one per wheel -- it
never runs an installer itself (stdlib-only, no subprocess here).
