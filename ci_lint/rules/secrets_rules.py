"""Group 5: secrets and permissions.

SEC-001 is a raw-text regex scan (secrets can appear inside `env:`, `with:`,
`if:` or `run:` values alike, so matching text directly is both simpler and
more robust than depending on a full YAML parse). SEC-002 needs the parsed
job/permissions structure, so it follows the same PyYAML/yq/needs_review
fallback as the other structural rules.

Round-4B refinement: top-level workflow `permissions:` may be at most
`contents: read` + `actions: read` (evidence: zackees/template-python-rust-
cmd#19 had to add two [[exceptions]] just to grant `actions: read`, which
this refinement makes free instead of exception-worthy). Any JOB may also
hold `contents: read`/`actions: read` for free; any wider per-job grant
(`actions: write`, `id-token: write`, `contents: write`, ...) is SEC-002
unless the job's id is listed for that exact grant in `ci.toml`'s new
`[allow].permissions` table. `id-token: write` additionally must sit on an
OIDC publisher -- the `publish` job in `[publish].pypi.environment`, or a
crates.io trusted-publishing job running rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action
under an `environment:` (ci.yml#134) -- being allowlisted in
`[allow].permissions` does not waive that second constraint.
