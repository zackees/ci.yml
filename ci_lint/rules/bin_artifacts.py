"""BIN-001, BIN-002 (round M2-20, zackees/ci.yml#44 part A): per
docs/policy-rust.md, a repository that ships a native-binary app must
declare both a Linux libc variant floor and every required Windows
ABI/architecture combination as distinct `[platforms]` entries -- these
rules only apply once `[python].cli.native` is true (a repository whose
CLI is not a native binary has nothing to check here).

BIN-001: at least one `group = "linux"` platform's `target` must be a
`*-unknown-linux-musl` triple (the portable floor), or the repository must
carry a `[[exceptions]]` entry recording why glibc-only is acceptable.

BIN-002: every declared `group = "windows"` platform must use the MSVC ABI
(`*-pc-windows-msvc`, never `-gnu`), and `x86_64`/`aarch64` must each map to
their own platform id -- a target string with the wrong arch-in-triple vs.
arch-in-id (e.g. an id named `windows-arm64` whose target is the x64
triple) is flagged as a substitution.
