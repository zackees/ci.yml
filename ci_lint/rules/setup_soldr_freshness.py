"""RUST-014: a SHA-pinned `zackees/setup-soldr` must not be missing a
critical fix, or drift more than N releases behind latest (zackees/ci.yml
#33, reconciling SEC-004's SHA-pin requirement with #18's float-by-default
direction).

Context (issue #33): `RUST-013` (issue #18) already flags an exact `soldr==`
pin or a literal `setup-soldr` `version:` input with no recorded exception,
and pushes the fleet toward `zackees/setup-soldr@v0` (floating). But
`SEC-004` requires every third-party `uses:` be pinned to a 40-hex commit
SHA, and some repositories additionally have GitHub's own
`sha_pinning_required` setting on, which rejects a floating `@v0` ref before
any job even runs (zackees/soldr had to be re-pinned by SHA in soldr#3445).
For those repositories a SHA pin is not itself a defect -- RUST-013 already
carves that out via `[[exceptions]]` -- but a SHA pin that has gone stale
silently costs the whole fleet CI time: setup-soldr#539/#541 (v0.9.81/
v0.9.82) fixed Dylint caches never saving (`RUST-004`), and every repo below
that pin kept paying for a fully cold Dylint run on every commit (issue #31:
kernal-api's Dylint job at ~9.5 min, 0 HIT / 2078 MISS).

Policy (recorded in docs/policy-rust.md): a SHA pin is allowed (it is in
fact REQUIRED wherever `sha_pinning_required` is on, or wherever RUST-013's
`[[exceptions]]` records a deliberate exact pin), but the pinned commit must
not be missing a release setup-soldr's own maintainers marked critical, and
must not drift more than `MAX_RELEASES_BEHIND` releases behind the latest
release. This is the SHA-pin analogue of RUST-013's floating-pin freshness
requirement -- RUST-013 says "don't freeze silently", RUST-014 says "if you
must freeze, the freeze must not silently rot". Unlike RUST-013 (a static
precheck rule, so `ci.toml`'s `[[exceptions]]` table can mark a deliberate
exact pin), RUST-014 is a LIVE check run only by `ci-lint audit` --
`ci_lint.exceptions.apply_exceptions` is never applied to `ci-lint audit`
findings (same as SEC-005/006/007 and GEN-006/010/011 above), so it cannot
be silenced through `[[exceptions]]`; a repository with a documented reason
to stay behind records that reason in the PR, not in ci.toml.

Mechanics: this is a LIVE check (needs the GitHub releases API for
`zackees/setup-soldr` itself, a repository unrelated to whichever repo is
being linted), wired into `ci-lint audit` exactly like SEC-005/006/007 and
GEN-006/010/011 -- same injectable `FetchStatusFn`, same "403 is
needs_review, never a silent pass" discipline as `ci_lint.settings_audit`.

  1. Statically find every `zackees/setup-soldr[...]@<40-hex-sha>` `uses:`
     in the repository's workflows and composite actions (the base action
     and its `/cook`, `/cleanup` sub-actions all share the pin's freshness).
  2. For each distinct pinned SHA, `GET /repos/zackees/setup-soldr/commits/
     {sha}` for its commit date. A 404 means the ref doesn't exist on
     setup-soldr's default branch history as a commit GitHub can resolve
     (e.g. a squash-merged/rewritten SHA) -- reported `needs_review`, never
     silently skipped.
  3. `GET /repos/zackees/setup-soldr/releases` (non-draft, non-prerelease,
     newest first, as GitHub already orders them) and keep every release
     published strictly after the pinned commit's date -- those are the
     releases this pin is missing.
  4. A missing release is "critical" when its name or body contains the
     word "critical" (case-insensitive) -- setup-soldr's own maintainers'
     documented way of flagging a release in its notes (issue #33's #539/
     #541 precedent: this repo's own case study). ANY missing critical
     release is a violation naming that release. Otherwise, more than
     `MAX_RELEASES_BEHIND` missing releases (regardless of criticality) is
     also a violation -- unbounded drift is itself the failure mode #33
     describes ("10 of 13 repos" stale, spread across nine different refs).
