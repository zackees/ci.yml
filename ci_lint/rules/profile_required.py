"""Group 13: GEN-003 -- a profile-required check skipped via a literal

`if: false` guard (M2-21, ci.yml#44 part B).

Prior to this round `docs/policy-general.md` marked GEN-003 a candidate
because no fleet-wide inventory/profile registry exists yet to check a
repository's declared checks against (issue #2). That gap is still real:
this repository's own suite/flow/tag/plan machinery dispatches a required
suite's `run` command dynamically (through `ci-lint plan`'s matrix/tag
selection), so a static scan cannot reliably tell "this suite's run command
never appears as a literal `run:` line" apart from "this suite is invoked
through the plan, as designed" -- attempting that produced false positives
against this repository's own canonical green fixture.

What IS reliably static, and unambiguous, is a suite marked
`[suites.<id>].required = true` whose invoking step (or that step's job) is
disabled with a literal `if: false` / `if: 'false'` -- there is no
conditional logic to evaluate; the step can never run, full stop. That is
"skipped" in the M2-21 brief's sense, and it is what this rule enforces. A
suite whose run command never appears as a literal `run:` line anywhere
stays `needs_review` (not a pass, not a hard violation) until the
fleet-wide inventory (issue #2) exists to check "wired via the plan" for
real; see docs/policy-general.md's GEN-003 row for the still-open half.
