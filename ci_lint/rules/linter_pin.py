"""CT-007: a `linter` pin must name a commit that exists.

`ci.toml`'s top-level `linter = "zackees/ci.yml@<40-hex>"` names the exact
ci-lint commit a repository's precheck runs. `CT-002` already checks that the
string is *well formed* -- 40 hex characters after an `@`. It cannot check
that the commit is *real*, and that distinction is the whole bug:

    linter = "zackees/ci.yml@fe965fc7e2c5203570072e1d0fd19d0935d98e39"

is a perfect CT-002 pass and a commit that has never existed in zackees/ci.yml.

## Why a dead pin is worse than a stale one

`ci-lint local-gate run` resolves the declared pin BEFORE executing any lane,
so an unresolvable pin means the gate cannot run at all: no `Local-Gate:`
trailer can be produced, and every PR fails GATE-003 with a red cascade behind
it. Precheck degrades too, since the tool it is supposed to run cannot be
fetched.

A *stale* pin merely misses newer rules. A dead one disables the repository's
entire local verification.

## Measured 2026-10-05

A fleet-wide audit of all 37 repositories found **two dead pins**, both
introduced by the cache-policy workstream hours earlier and neither caught by
any existing check:

- `zackees/bosn` -- `fe965fc7e2c5203570072e1d0fd19d0935d98e39`
- `zackees/soldr` -- `a07bab94f16124b5c6857b137a237a53a61e06d1`

Both return 422 from the GitHub API and are absent from the object store
entirely, so no branch or tag can recover them. Nine repositories pin a live
commit; no pin was merely stale (the oldest was 1.5 days behind main), which
is why the failure mode here is deadness and not drift.

## Why this is `needs_review`

Resolvability is a question about a REMOTE repository, so the honest check
needs a live call. Offline, this rule can only confirm the shape (CT-002's
job) and say nothing more -- so with no fetch supplied it stays silent rather
than guessing. `--live` supplies the fetch and a dead pin becomes a finding.
