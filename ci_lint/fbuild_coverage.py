"""`ci-lint fbuild coverage-check`: the `fbuild-coverage-preserved` acceptance
fixture (zackees/ci.yml#39, sub-issue of #4/#52; proposal.md's "Explicit
acceptance fixture: fbuild-coverage-preserved" section).

Proves, mechanically, that a proposed/faster CI shape for a repository built
like `FastLED/fbuild` still requires at least everything a pinned real
snapshot of that repository required:

    existing required coverage ⊆ declared coverage

Deleting any required case -- a board build, a macOS architecture, the
ignored Python facade suite, a full-graph gate, or a standalone required
check -- must turn this fixture red (AGENTS.md: "Confirm coverage from
commands and runs, not from a runner label").

Like `ci_lint.example_drift`, this module reads its `ci.toml` inputs over
raw `tomllib` (never through `ci_lint.schema`'s typed schema-3 loader):
its job is comparing a `[coverage]` declaration against a pinned snapshot,
not validating a repository's whole CI configuration. The board registry
(`ci/board_families.json` in the real repository) is itself the primary
evidence: `board_registry` in `[coverage]` points at a copy of it, and
loading it is what turns 80 registry entries (4 duplicate `workflow`
aliases sharing one `env_name`) into 76 distinct required board build
cases -- see `ci_lint/tests/fixtures/fbuild/SOURCE.md`.
