# ci-attestations: per-gate evidence in commit messages (GATE-010)

**Status:** candidate GATE-010, phase 1 implemented in `ci_lint` and piloted in zackees/soldr. Policy issue: [#198](https://github.com/zackees/ci.yml/issues/198); soldr companion: [soldr#3534](https://github.com/zackees/soldr/issues/3534). This document is the format reference; the binding text is in [policy-general.md](policy-general.md#per-gate-attestations-gate-010).

## Goal

Systematize the pattern of writing attestations into PR content. An attestation lives in the **commit message**, never in the source tree. Each one is validated on the host that ran the gate and published with the commit.
- **Definition:** `ci-attestations.yml`, YAML with comments allowed.
- **Transit:** compact JSON, one `Ci-Attestation:` trailer per gate.

CI then skips each remote job whose gates are all attested. As a side effect it also records which commits are known good, which tells it which caches are valid to hydrate.

## The definition: `ci-attestations.yml`

```yaml
# soldr's pilot definition (comments allowed)
version: 1
gates:
  rust/all/fmt: {lane: rust}
  rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/clippy: {lane: rust}
  rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/dylint: {lane: rust}
  rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test: {lane: tests}    # nextest + doctests (glibc)
  rust/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/clippy: {lane: cross}    # extra coverage: no PR job runs this
jobs:
  ci.yml:build-linux-x64:
    - rust/all/fmt
    - rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/clippy
    - rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/dylint
    - rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test
```

- **Gate path:** `<ecosystem>/<platform>/<check>`. The ecosystem is `rust`, `python` or `general`. For Rust, the platform is a target triple or `all`.
- **`lane`:** the local-gate lane (GATE-007) whose pass proves the gate.
- **`fidelity`** (GATE-011): `native` (default), `vm` (the real OS in a local VM) or `emulation` (Wine, Darling). Only `native`/`vm` lanes may prove a `test` check; an emulation lane attests a scoped check such as `unit`.
- **`jobs`:** maps a remote job (`<workflow>:<job id>`) to the gates it runs. A job can be skipped only when every one of its gates is attested.
- **Restricted YAML** (`ci_lint.mini_yaml`, standard library only):
  - allowed: block mappings and sequences, flow `{..}`/`[..]` of scalars, and comments;
  - rejected: anchors, aliases, tags, merge keys, block scalars, and multiple documents.

  A bare developer host and a CI runner therefore parse it identically, with nothing installed.
- **Read from the PR base** in CI (like `[gate.trust]`). The file is an automatic GATE-008 surface: a PR that changes it runs remotely.

## The attestation: compact JSON trailer

`ci-lint local-gate run` writes one trailer per declared gate whose lane passed, whether it ran or was reused from the GATE-007 cache. These sit beside the existing `Local-Gate:` trailer:

```
Local-Gate: v1 tree=5a60710e... secs=510 lanes=py-static:reused@be00dc106fad,...,tests:run
Ci-Attestation: {"at":1790917000,"gate":"rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test","host":"linux-x86_64","key":"9f3c...","lane":"tests","parents":["6f6b886c..."],"secs":506,"stamp":"3b0e...","tree":"5a60710e...","v":1,"via":"run"}
```

- **Omission means not run.** A declared gate with no trailer runs remotely. There is no "skipped" entry.
- **Stamp:** `sha256(tree \n parents \n canonical-json-without-stamp)`, truncated to 32 hex digits. A commit's hash covers its own message, so the stamp binds the tree and the parents instead. Editing the JSON, changing content, or rebasing invalidates it (`bad-stamp`, `wrong-tree`, `wrong-parents`). The stamp is tamper-evident; it is not a signature.
- **Size:** about 330 bytes per gate. Five gates add under 2 KiB to the commit message.
- **Freshness for hosted skips:** the verifier uses each lane's `max-age-hours` from the PR base (default 24 hours). Expired evidence or timestamps more than 60 seconds in the future cannot authorize a skip. Reuse preserves the original execution timestamp. `attest verify` without an age policy checks integrity only.

## In CI

1. **Verify job:** `ci-lint local-gate verify --trust --github-output`, with full history. Don't leave ci_lint inside the tree while repository checks run: a `.ci-lint/` directory trips repository-local static checks (zackees/clud's banned-imports check flagged ci_lint's subprocess use). `actions/checkout` refuses a `path` outside `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so either (a) check it out at `.ci-lint`, run the verify step, then remove it in an `if: always()` step (`rm -rf .ci-lint`; clud's `Drop ci_lint checkout`), or (b) skip `actions/checkout` and fetch the pinned SHA with `git` into `$RUNNER_TEMP/ci-lint`, invoking `PYTHONPATH=$RUNNER_TEMP/ci-lint`.
   Under local workflow replay (`ACT=true`), verification reports
   `attested=false` and `state=local-replay`; trust and per-job skip outputs
   are false, even when HEAD already has attestations. The replay executes
   the checks that will create fresh proof, and cannot require that proof
   before it runs. Hosted verification and pre-push enforcement are unchanged.
   - GATE-008's head-level policy applies first: base policy, surfaces, author, fork, `ci-full`, and the audit sample.
   - Then, per `[gate.trust].skip` job, it outputs **`skip_<job id>`**, which is `true` only when every gate the base definition maps to that job has a valid attestation.
   - Each skip job's `if:` consumes `needs.<verify>.outputs.skip_<job id>`.
2. **Push events never skip,** so the default-branch run is the post-merge catch. **Release ignores attestations, always.**
   A publisher can use one trusted invocation: `ci-lint attest keys --github-context --out-dir "$RUNNER_TEMP/ci-attestations" --slots 16 --github-output`. The checker reads the event file itself, selects the same-repository PR head/base or the default-branch push, and ignores release/tag/schedule/dispatch events. Use `contents: read` and `pull-requests: read` for the publisher and grant these through any reusable-workflow caller.
   Existing publishers may opt into `attest keys --promote-merged-pr --fetch-promotion-source` with `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, `GITHUB_EVENT_NAME`, and `GITHUB_REF`. On a default-branch push, it finds exactly one associated merged PR whose merge SHA is the pushed commit; requires the same repository, the original base's GATE-008 trust decision, unchanged gate definition, and exact PR-head/pushed-tree identity; verifies the source trailers; and rebinds fresh records to the pushed commit's parents. The original evidence timestamp is preserved (default freshness: 24 hours). The optional fetch reads the same-repository PR head into a local ref when squash history omitted it; it validates numeric PR IDs and commit SHAs, checks the fetched head against the API SHA, and times out after 60 seconds. It changes local Git refs but performs no GitHub writes. Missing history, API errors, changed surfaces, audit-sampled heads, shadow/disabled trust, malformed evidence, tags, and release events publish no promoted evidence.
   Promotion writes side files under the pushed commit's main lineage, consumed by the existing `attest resolve --require-gate` cache selector. It does not modify the merged commit or skip main/release jobs. Build caches must also be saved on main under the matching lineage: PR-scoped cache payloads remain inaccessible from main, and promoting a side record alone does not transfer those payloads.
3. **Side entries for caching:** `ci-lint attest keys --pr <N> --base <sha> --out-dir D --github-output` writes each valid attestation to a tiny file. It outputs `key_<i>` / `path_<i>`, and the workflow saves each one as its own cache entry. Entries are tiny (bytes), and the repository's entry budget is large, so many are fine.
4. **Hydration:** `ci-lint attest resolve --family <cache family> [--require-gate <gate>]` lists cache keys through the REST API (GET only). It picks the **nearest ancestor** entry of that family, optionally only from commits whose side entry for the required gate exists, so a build cache is hydrated only from an attested-good state.

## Human-readable, ancestor-defining cache keys

```
<family>-m<n>-<sha10>              default-branch commit, n = first-parent ordinal on main
<family>-m<b>-c<k>-<sha10>-pr-<N>  PR #N's commit, k first-parent commits above its base m<b>
```

Examples, with real soldr values:
- `att1-rust.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.test-m2189-c1-18204251ce-pr-3532`
- `zccache-unit-v1-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-m2190-4b4f981d09`

**Why the PR component is a suffix (experiment K2).** The first draft was `pr-<N>-m<b>-c<k>-<sha10>`, after the owner's `*-pr-NN-(commit ordinal)` sketch. soldr's `check_pr_cache_keys.py` (CACHE-013) already requires every PR-reachable cache save to carry `${{ env.PR_CACHE_TAG }}`, which is exactly `-pr-<N>` in a PR and empty elsewhere. With the tag as a suffix:
- one key shape (`<stem>${{ env.PR_CACHE_TAG }}`) serves both main and PRs;
- the existing checkers and janitor accept it unchanged;
- `ci-lint attest keys` outputs both the full `key_<i>` and the `stem_<i>` a workflow appends the tag to.

What makes the labels ancestor-defining:
- **Ancestry is readable from the key alone,** without git:
  - `m<i>` precedes `m<j>` iff i < j (main is never rewritten);
  - `m<b>-c<i>-…-pr-N` can precede `m<b>-c<j>-…-pr-N` only if i < j and the bases match;
  - a main entry can precede a PR commit only if its ordinal is at most the PR's base ordinal.
- **The SHA prefix lets git confirm it** (`merge-base --is-ancestor`) when history was rewritten.

## Two encodings of ancestry (unreconciled, #185)

setup-soldr's ancestor pilot ([#566](https://github.com/zackees/setup-soldr/pull/566))
records ancestry under a **different key shape** than the one above:

```
setup-soldr-ancestor-build-v1-<identity>-source-<sha>-run-<n>-attempt-<n>[-pr-<N>]
```

`ci_lint.cache_lineage.parse_key` returns `None` for these. They are two encodings,
not two truths -- both record ancestry and both survive a merge. They differ in **how
selection is decided**, and the difference is a real tradeoff rather than a cosmetic one:

| | this document's `m<n>` label | setup-soldr's ancestor key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| selection | first-parent ordinal, read from the key | shortest **parent-edge distance** from a live `git` DAG walk (`dagDistances`) |
| needs git at selection time | no | yes (bounded to 200 nodes, one bounded `fetch --depth=200`, `merge-base --is-ancestor` confirm) |
| survives history rewrite | ordinal moves with a rebase | distance is recomputed, so it cannot go stale |
| across a merge | `m<i>`/`m<j>` compare ordinals | edge distance crosses both arms correctly |
| implemented | `ci_lint.cache_lineage.resolve` | merged (#566) but **unreleased** -- no tag contains it |

**Neither is wrong.** The ordinal is cheaper (no checkout, no fetch, works in a
`ci-lint` invocation far from a git repo) but it is a proxy for ancestry, and it can
collide. Measured on a scratch repo (2026-10-05):

- a rewritten main commit (amend or squash replacing a commit) shares `m<n>` with the
  commit it replaced -- both report `m5` -- and differs only in the 10-hex SHA, so
  `m<i>` precedes `m<j>` iff i < j is **false** there: neither precedes the other, they
  are siblings wearing one ordinal;
- two sibling PR branches at the same depth share `c<k>` too, which is harmless because
  `pr-<N>` already separates them.

So the ordinal orders *history positions*, not *ancestry*, and the SHA prefix is load-
bearing rather than decorative: it is the only part of the label that distinguishes a
rewritten commit from its replacement. That is exactly why experiment K1 measures 17% of
soldr's PR pushes rewriting history (12 rebases, 4 amends) and why `resolve` confirms with
`merge-base --is-ancestor`. Edge distance has no such case -- it is recomputed from the
live DAG, so it cannot go stale -- but it costs a bounded DAG walk per candidate, which
is why `selectAncestorCache` caps candidates at 200 inspected and 20 ranked and falls
back to `legacy-fallback` on any backend error.

Which one the fleet standardizes on is [#185](https://github.com/zackees/ci.yml/issues/185)'s
open question, and it should be decided **before** repositories start producing keys in
both shapes -- two live encodings with different selection semantics is how promotion
ends up looking broken when it is not. Until it is decided, `parse_key` must not be
widened to accept both: a parser that accepts two incompatible ancestry semantics would
silently rank entries under the wrong one.

Adoption state, 2026-10-05: this label is live only on `att1-*` attestation side-entries
(70 entries/0.00 GiB in soldr, 85/0.00 GiB in bosn) against 5.97 GiB and 4.41 GiB of
bare-hash build caches; zccache, clud and kernal-api have none. See `CACHE-031`.

## Experiments (soldr pilot)

- **K1, ancestry across pushes.** 92 consecutive PR-head transitions (46 branches, 2026-09-25..10-02, GitHub compare API):
  - **76 (83%) were fast-forwards:** the earlier head is an ancestor, so `c<k>` ordering holds.
  - **16 diverged:** 12 rebases onto a newer main (`m<b>` moves forward, so the nearest ancestor becomes a `main-m` entry) and 4 content amends or squashes (same `m`, different SHA, caught by the SHA check).
  - **None** were message-only amends.
- **X1, cross-target Clippy on a Linux host.**
  - `soldr cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --target aarch64-apple-darwin` passed in 111 s cold.
  - `--target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` ran in 74 s and **found 3 real warnings on soldr `main`** (two test-only items compiled into the library, and an unused import). No ordinary PR job runs Windows Clippy, so they had gone unnoticed. Attesting "Clippy (all platforms)" locally is cheap, and it catches what PR CI cannot.
- **Resolve on soldr history:** for PR #3532 (`m2189-c1-…-pr-3532`), the resolver picks `m2189` and rejects `m2191`, which is not an ancestor. With `--require-gate …/test` and only `m2188` attested, it picks `m2188`.

## Pilot results (soldr)

| PR | GATE-008/010 decision | CI wall time |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| soldr#3537 (phase-1 wiring; surfaces changed) | `surface-changed`: both jobs ran; the publisher found no definition at the base | ~14 min |
| **soldr#3541** (first ordinary PR: the Windows Clippy fixes X1 found) | trusted; `ci.yml:lint` skip (2/2 gates), `ci.yml:build-linux-x64` skip (5/5) | **20 s** |

- `CI Pre › Publish ci-attestations` saved 7 entries of about 430 B each, e.g. `att1-rust.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.test-m2192-c1-59fd7786bc-pr-3541`. `ci-lint attest resolve` found them through the live REST listing (GET only).
- **The squash commit can carry valid attestations.** #3537's `main` push (d17f707) published `att1-…-m2192-d17f7071c1` on `refs/heads/main`. The PR was up to date with main, so the squash commit had the attested head's exact tree and parent, and its stamps genuinely hold. These `main`-scoped entries are readable from every branch, so they are what later PRs hydrate from. When the PR is behind main, the stamps are rejected (`wrong-tree`/`wrong-parents`). Either way, `main` pushes run every job.

## Roadmap and status

1. **Phase 2: done** (soldr#3548). The `cross` lane attests `rust/{x86_64-pc-windows-msvc,aarch64-apple-darwin}/{clippy,dylint}` from the Linux host. It passes 5/5 checks: 307 s warm, 815 s cold.
2. **Phase 3: done** (soldr#3548), with platform test lanes chosen by fidelity ([#202](https://github.com/zackees/ci.yml/issues/202)):

   | Lane | Fidelity | Attests | Measured |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | `wine` (container) | emulation | `rust/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/unit`, for the crates that pass in full | 400 tests, about 8 s |
   | `winvm` (warm dockur/windows VM, optional) | native-equivalent | `rust/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/test`, the target-run partition | 160/160, 400–492 s |
   | Darling | emulation with process/IPC gaps | nothing (advisory) | broker/daemon wedge; `readdir`/`copy` gaps |
   | macOS Recovery guest | native-equivalent | `rust/x86_64-apple-darwin/test` replay set (next) | kernal-api: 950 tests in 163 s |

   - A `…/test` gate takes only a native or native-equivalent lane.
   - Emulation lanes attest a distinct check name (`unit`) with an explicit crate scope.
   - **Host-optional lanes** (`optional = true`, exit 75) are never attested where they cannot run.
3. **Phase 4: done** (soldr#3549 and soldr#3550). The Tier-2 zccache store is saved under lineage keys (`…-m<n>-<sha10>`). Linux x64 restores the nearest ancestor generation whose commit has a valid `rust/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test` side entry (`attest resolve --require-gate`, GET-only, advisory, prefix fallback). Verified live: `main` m2201 published both, the resolver picks `…-m2201-9f92fdbe37`, and it skips m2200, whose test gate overflowed the old 8 slots (fixed in #218: job-mapped gates are published first, and overflow is a `::warning`). Next: the Dylint trees and cross lanes.
4. **Isolation:** the isolated runner proves which tree it tested (GATE-009, `.gate-nonce`; bosn 0.1.7 fixed the container reuse at the root).

## Fleet rollouts (goal 3)

Measured results of rolling the local gate and attestations out beyond soldr. Single samples are marked; the raw figures are in [designs/ci-attestations-ledger.json](designs/ci-attestations-ledger.json) under `rollouts`.

| Repository | PRs | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| zccache | #1881, #1882, #1883, #1884 | PR CI median 1109 s -> 644 s (one sample); integration 1060 s -> 14 s. The pre-prune barrier caused ~93% of main-push failures; fixed in #1884 (see candidate `CACHE-026`). Timing-budget tests are flaky under host load; the gate container must run non-root. |
| llvm-ld | #71, #72 | #71 moves the allocator benchmark to path-filtered/nightly: ~-24% to -31% runner-minutes per PR (projected). #72: the Windows zccache cache gets 0 hits (0/1791), candidate `CACHE-027`. |
| mimalloc-pprof | #599, #600, #601 | #599 pytest-xdist: python-lint 3m30 -> 2m16. #600/#601: python-lint 3m30 -> 12 s on an attested PR, ~83 s total to green. Only `python-lint.yml` is gated of ~15 PR workflows (now a GATE-002 `needs_review`); `if: always()` gate jobs went red ~270 times in a week (candidate `GATE-013`). |
| soldr | #3555 | lane fidelity (`GATE-011`). |
| ci.yml | #244, #245 | ci-lint rollout defect fixes (GATE-009/005/008, RUST-001) and the GHAPI-001 complexity split. |
